# Backend internship project Autumn 2022

During this internship project we will investigate the migration process from version 2 to 3 to make it as easy as possible for our customers. 

## Fork & Pull Request Workflow

1. Create your own fork.
2. Clone the fork to your computer.
3. Create a new development branch on your fork.
4. Do all coding in your development branch.
5. When done, merge upstream/master and rebase your development branch.
6. If appropriate, squash your commits.
7. Make a pull request.
